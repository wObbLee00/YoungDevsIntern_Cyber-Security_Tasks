5. **Linking Authenticator App:**
   - Opened my authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) and scanned the QR code provided by LinkedIn to add my LinkedIn account.
   - ![Step 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0819085-0f62-4ca2-aac4-7443a5069c30)


6. **Complete the Setup:**
   - After successfully scanning the QR code, the authenticator app generated a time-based one-time password (TOTP), which I entered into LinkedIn to complete the 2FA setup process.
   - ![Step 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edf68c14-4db0-4066-a064-1dc714fb43c1)

By completing this process, I ensured my LinkedIn account now requires both my password and a verification code from my authenticator app for secure login.
